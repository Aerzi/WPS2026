# Market Scan: Presentation Feedback & Collaboration Mechanisms

**Target Audience:** Product Manager - Comments/Annotations Module
**Objective:** Analyze how leading tools handle feedback during the presentation creation and rehearsal lifecycle.

## 1. Collaborative Slide Feedback (Static)
*   **Tools:** Pitch.com, Google Slides, Figma (Slide decks).
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   **Contextual Comments:** Users can pin comments to specific elements (images, text boxes) or the slide canvas.
    *   **Resolution Workflow:** Comments have "Open," "Resolved," and "Threaded" states.
    *   **Live Collaboration:** Pitch.com introduces "Live Video" cursors, where users can talk over the slides while pointing, but comments remain text-based anchors.
    *   **Innovation:** **Pitch** allows recording a "Video Sticker" as a comment—a short loom-style video bubble attached to a slide element.

## 2. Rehearsal & Video Feedback (Time-Based)
*   **Tools:** Yoodli, Orai, Loom, Vimeo (Review mode).
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   **Timeline Annotations:** Feedback is anchored to a specific *timestamp* in the video recording, not just a slide.
    *   **Transcript-Based Commenting:** Users can highlight text in the *auto-generated transcript*, which links to that exact moment in the video.
    *   **AI vs. Human Layering:**
        *   *AI Layer:* Auto-tags "Filler Words" or "Pacing Issues" on the timeline.
        *   *Human Layer:* Mentors/Peers add subjective comments ("Great energy here!", "Confusing explanation") on the same timeline.

## 3. Advanced Annotation Systems (Frame.io / Video Production Model)
*   **Relevance:** High-end rehearsal coaching often mimics video production review.
*   **Features:**
    *   **Drawing on Video:** Reviewers can draw on the video frame (e.g., circling a distracting hand gesture) at a specific timestamp.
    *   **Range-Based Comments:** Comments that span a duration (e.g., "From 2:00 to 2:30, your voice is too monotone").

## Strategic Opportunities for Module Owner
1.  **Hybrid Anchoring:** Allow comments to attach to *both* a Slide Object (spatial) AND a specific timestamp in the rehearsal recording (temporal).
2.  **Reaction Overlays:** Implement "Micro-feedback" (thumbs up, heart, confusion face) that reviewers can tap in real-time while watching a rehearsal, generating a "sentiment heat map" on the timeline.
3.  **Voice Comments:** Allow reviewers to leave voice notes, as typing during a live rehearsal watch-party is distracting.
