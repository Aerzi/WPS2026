## Prerequisites
To use Speaker Coach effectively, ensure you have:
1.  **Microphone**: A computer microphone capable of clearly hearing your speech [1].
2.  **Internet Connection**: Required for the service to function [1].
3.  **Microsoft Account**: Sign in with a personal account (hotmail.com, outlook.com, etc.) or a Microsoft 365 work/school account [1].
4.  **Compatible Browser** (for Web): Edge (v15+), Chrome (v52+), or Firefox (v52+) [1].

## Step-by-Step Instructions (Web Example)
1.  **Open Presentation**: Open your slide show in PowerPoint for the web.
2.  **Start Coach**: Go to the **Slide Show** tab and select **Rehearse with Coach**. (Or use the **View** tab if the Simplified Ribbon is disabled).
3.  **Begin**: The presentation will enter full-screen mode. Click **Get Started** at the lower right.
4.  **Rehearse**: Speak naturally. The Coach will provide on-screen guidance in the lower-right corner regarding pacing, language, etc.
5.  **Finish**: Exit full-screen view when done.
6.  **Review**: A **Rehearsal Report** will automatically open, summarizing observations and recommendations.

## Best Practices & Tips
*   **Environment**: Rehearse in a quiet place to ensure accurate speech recognition [1].
*   **One Speaker**: The tool works best with a single speaker; multiple voices may confuse it [1].
*   **Saving Reports**: The report disappears after closing. **Take a screenshot** if you wish to save the feedback [1].
*   **Relaxation**: Take deep breaths to slow down if nervous. Pauses are acceptable and do not negatively affect the score [1].
*   **Delivery**: Speak naturally and vary your pitch to keep the audience engaged.
*   **Slide Content**: It is acceptable to repeat short bits of text (titles, bullets), but avoid reading entire slides [1].
